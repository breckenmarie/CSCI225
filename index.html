            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Hi there! My name is Brecken Merrill. I'm a senior at the University of South Carolina Aiken, 
                majoring in Computer Science with an applied concentration in Cyber Security. 
                With this degree, I plan on getting a job in cybersecurity; however, if I get the opportunity, 
                I would love to continue school and get my master's degree and potentially a Ph.D. in Computer Science. 
                In addition to getting my Bachelor's Degree, I graduated from Central Carolina Technical College 
                in 2022 with my Associate's Degree in Art. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, I am the Vice President of USCA's Esports club. 
                I am active on the school's Discord server and the Overwatch 2 team. 
                I love playing video games, with Overwatch 2 being one of my favorite FPS games; 
                I have been playing Overwatch 2 since 2018 (back when it was Overwatch 1)! 
                I have recently gotten back into Fortnite as well. Some of my favorite single-player games 
                include Red Dead Redemption 2 and Skyrim. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to video games, I love sewing, drawing, and writing--pretty much anything creative! 
                I also love to cosplay; I currently only have one cosplay, Kiriko from Overwatch 2, 
                but I would love to expand my collection. My goal is to make my cosplays and props one day. 
                I am also learning how to animate and hope to be able to make animations of my original characters one day.
            </p>

                        I created my first website during high school using HTML. 
                        It was a website designed for customers of my family's farm: Southern Oaks.
                        It contained images, external and internal links, and was fully designed.

                    Choose-Your-Own Adventure Game
                    <p>
                        My final project for my CSCI 125 class was a choose-your-own adventure game created using Python. 
                        It had multiple choices that the user could pick, and each led to a different ending.
